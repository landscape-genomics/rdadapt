\title{RDA based detection of outlier loci}
\usage{
rdadapt(RDA, K, zscores)

\S4method{rdadapt}{rda,ANY,ANY}(RDA, K)

\S4method{rdadapt}{missing,missing,data.frame}(zscores)

\S4method{rdadapt}{missing,missing,matrix}(zscores)
}
\arguments{
\item{RDA}{the RDA model from which to extract loci loadings for the outlier detection.}

\item{K}{an integer specifying the number of RDA axes to retain.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} containing :
\itemize{
  \item \code{p.values} : the p-value associated with each locus
  \item \code{q.values} : the q-value associated with each locus, estimated using the \code{q.values} package and allowing to use a FDR (False Discovery Rate) approach instead of a p-value threshold to identify outliers.
}
}
\description{
\code{rdadapt} performs redundancy analysis and computes p-values to
test for outliers based on loci extremeness along a distribution of Mahalanobis distances 
estimated between each locus and the center of the RDA space using a certain number of axes (K). 
\code{rdadapt} accommodates individual genotypes or allele frequencies.
}
\details{
First, Mahalanobis distances are computed for all genetic marker using a robust estimate of both mean and covariance matrix between the \code{K} RDA vectors of loadings.
Then, to compute p-values, Mahalanobis distances are divided by a genomic inflation factor (\code{gif}), giving a scaled statistic that should follow a chi-squared distribution with \code{K} degrees of freedom.
