# rdadapt

R package `rdadapt` was developed to facilitate the exploration and projection of the gene \~ environment relationship across current and future landscapes. The package provides various statistical tools to conduct **landscape genomic analyses** going from identifying the genetic bases of adaptation within a species to predict future population (mal)adaptation to climate change.

A tutorial for `rdadatpt` is available on this website.

**News:** A paper is in preparation describing version 1 of rdadapt.
